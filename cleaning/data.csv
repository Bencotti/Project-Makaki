For example, in the Central Catchment Area, visitors are warned to keep plastic bags out of sight, lest monkeys attack the visitors in the hope to robbing the unwary of food. It seems like the worrying trend and nasty habit of seeking food from anthropogenic sources is catching on, as these photos show.

As can see, the tail is Super long like about 1 metre, for such a small monkey. Perhaps that’s why they’re also known as ‘long tailed macaques’. According to a guy who worked at Tanjong Beach Club, these 2 have been outcast from the main group of macaques and have made themselves home here and have stolen food from the Tanjong beach club restaurant quite often. 
Recently there was a photo shared by Lek Chailert from Elephant Nature Park via her Instagram of a bludgeoned to death Macaque mummy and her child, while the newborn was kept alive to be stolen and kept as a ‘trained monkey’ to perform tricks for tourists. It’s so disturbing. Please do not support any animal performance, especially in places like Thailand. Remember every time you support an animal performance, an animal mummy is brutally murdered to steal her baby.

Scientific & Common Name(s) 
The distinctive long-tail of this primate identifies it as a long-tailed macaque. Colloquially it is also sometimes referred to as the crab-eating macaque. Scientifically, it is known as Macaca fascicularis.

2. Habitat & Geographic Range 
The long-tailed macaque covers a huge range of habitats and geographic area, making it one of the most versatile and resilient primate species. Naturally, long-tailed macaques are found in a number of forest environments such as primary and secondary forest, mangroves, swamps, and riverine and coastal forests. Macaques also adapt well to habitats that have been disturbed by human activity such as plantation areas (Sha et al., 2009). This particular specimen in the Bukit Timah area of Singapore. These primates are native to Singapore (although the rapid urban development over the past few decades has lead to a decline in their numbers) but can also be found throughout the southern parts of Southeast Asia (e.g. Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, Bangladesh), and Sundaland (e.g. Borneo, Sumatra, Java) (Liedigk et al., 2015). Due to human activity, the long-tailed macaque has also been introduced into areas outside of their natural range such as Mauritius, Hong Kong, and West Papua (Sha et al., 2009).

3. Size /Weight & Lifespan
The tail of the long-tailed macaque, its characteristic feature, is, on average, between 40cm-65cm in length. Long-tailed macaques display sexual dimorphism in size and weight between males and females. Males are between 40cm and 65cm in length on average, and weigh between 5kg to 8kg. Females on the other hand tend to be between 38cm and 50cm in length, and weigh between 2.5kg to 6kg (Lang, 2006). The average lifespan is about 15-30 years, but closer to 30 years in captivity (AnAge, n.d.).  

4. Diet
The majority of a long-tailed macaques diet consists of fruit, flowers, nuts, seeds, insects, and tubers. That being said, as we have seen before, these primates are very versatile and will become more omnivorous if available food resources change. They will also steal food from humans in more urbanized areas, which is one of the major sources of human-macaque conflict in Singapore (Hadi et al., 2007, Malaivijitnond et al., 2007).

5. Reproduction & Communication
Reproduction is linked to dominance hierarchies for both males and females. Higher-ranking females have more offspring than lower-ranking females, and the dominant male will have the most number of offspring in the troupe. This is because the offspring of dominant females have a higher chance of survival due to better access to food and a decreased likelihood of being harassed by low-ranking females (van Noordwijk et al., 1988). Dominant males have higher reproductive success because they mate guard their females more effectively (Lang, 2006). Females have noticeable swelling in the anogenital region and produce distinct copulation calls when they are sexually ready. Generally, long-tailed macaques have two classes of vocalizations; harsh calls, used mostly for alarm, and clear calls, which promote friendly interactions. 
6. Predation: Does the animal have any predators?
The long-tailed macaque is mostly predated on by large carnivores (e.g. tigers), large reptiles (e.g. snakes and crocodiles), and large birds of prey (e.g. eagles) (Global Invasive Species Database, 2007).  
7. Conservation Status
According to IUCN, the Macaca fascicularis is in the “Least Concern” category, meaning that the species is not under any significant threat of extinction (Ong et al., 2008).

8. Did You Know?
The long-tailed macaques, as like many other primates, are known for their creative and deft manipulation of tools. In Singapore, where this particular individual was observed, macaques have been observed to carry out “leaf-washing” behaviours. Chiang observed long-tailed macaques performing washing behaviour to remove potentially harmful or unpleasant substances from potentially food items (Chiang, 1967). Macaques are also known to use other creative extractive foraging techniques (Pal et al., 2017) and tools (Gumert et al., 2013) based on their environments. Long-tailed macaques are highly intelligent primates!

The long-tailed macaque is the only commonly seen species of monkey in Singapore. Its population numbers some 1,500 individuals. Most dwell in and on the fringes of our rainforest nature reserves – the Bukit Timah and the Central Catchment Nature Reserves. They also occupy parks such as Bukit Batok Nature Park, Yishun Park and Admiralty Park, as well as Sisters Islands and Pulau Ubin. We saw many of it during our visit to Pulau Ubin — most of them being quite aggressive to humans! Holding plastic bags is a big no when walking around nature reserves as these macaques will steal them away from you!
